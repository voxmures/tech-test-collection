# Technical Test Collection

This repository is a collection of different technical tests I have done in the past and serves the purpose of helping the companies to see examples of my work, therefore avoiding the need of going through more technical tests.

Additional work can be seen in my [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ADqi_srtvgW_WUoXyZBmZGEhOBKuo8je), including the professional projects where I have been involved at.

Any other questions can be addressed to my email: camposcolmenarejo.joaquin (at) gmail (dot) com.
